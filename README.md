# Simple Neural Network Models using TensorFlow and PyTorch

This repository contains a jupyter notebook, showcasing a comparison of simple neural network (NN) architectures using TensorFlow and PyTorch. The notebook demonstrates the construction of base models, models with increased neurons, and models with additional hidden layers.

## Overview
In this project, I built and compared neural network architectures using two popular deep learning frameworks: TensorFlow and PyTorch. The goal was to analyze the effect of different configurations (number of neurons and hidden layers) on model performance.

## Key Experiments
- Base Model (TensorFlow & PyTorch):
  A simple feedforward neural network (FFNN) with one hidden layer.
- Increased Neurons:
  A modified network with a higher number of neurons in the hidden layer.
- Additional Hidden Layer:
  A deeper network with an extra hidden layer.
